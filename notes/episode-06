useEffect

it acccepts two arguments
1 -> callback function
2 -> dependecny

use effect calls when once the page is loaded and then it will invoke.


we have introduced new funcionality that is search the tabs

We learn how we call swiggy apis using fetch to grab the data.
Removed all the dummy data.

till page is loading we are showing to user a shimmer page instead of loading circle.

once page is loaded then we make a api call to fetch the data and render it into the ui.

we have used async await here to fetch the data.

Fetching data from swiggy api blocked by browser because of cors policy.
to avoid this we have added one extenstion in browser that allows to fetch the data.

shimmer : Shimmer is a fake page that we show to user.
This will have a better user experience.

Flow
Site load -> Shimmer show -> Render -> Request API -> get Data -> render original data

What is conditional rendering
when any data is loaded on any condition then it is called as conditional rendering.

Why do we need useState
for example : to maintaing login logout button for website
when login button change to logout
when logout button change to login

It will render whole component.
And the reconsilation algorithm check what changed and what to render.
It will render whole componentto re-render if the value is updated

In the code if you see we have used const variable.
If value is changed then  JS is not allowing to change const variable. then how it is changed.
because it is calling a function and again render whole component.



Why react is faster
React fiber's new reconsilation algorithm is responsible  for faster rendering.
whenever it is found the difference between dom then it will re-render updated it with newer value.
